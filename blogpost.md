#Purpose-built webapps in the modern workplace

Computer applications vary in complexity and are important components in the workplace. Applications can range from simple excel macros to publish your documents to full scale image manipulation like Photoshop.

As technology advanced and the internet began to grow, definitions started to stabilize, **web-based applications** began getting attention of the community and emerged as an alternative to installed applications. This was further supported by the HTML5 standard which was famously supported by Steve Jobs and ultimately led to the slow demise of Adobe Flash.

Web applications are incredible tools that help modernise work in the workplace. As code and automation become more common, it is likely that each department in the modern workplace will have its own *swiss-army webapp toolbox* to facilitate work processes and improve efficiency.

### Webapps and Data Science

Just like how code is being slowly more accessible to the layperson, web application frameworks are being developed to also help make web application development more accessible by helping to automate the complex overheads of web development.

As data scientists, the maturity of the web development frameworks is great news! It allows us to make use of web applications as a tool to bridge the gap between insights and action. Often times, I've found myself working with jupyter notebook for analytics-related work and struggling to share the findings with the people that matter. Jupyter notebooks are powerful tools for data science but are usually highly personalized and often difficult to appreciate without much hand-holding by the author.

I find web applications fit well into this niche as it allows end users to interact with the data meaningfully. It facilitates a transition into data-driven decision making by allowing business users to tap into business knowledge to better derive patterns and insights from their data.

An additional advantage of web application is also that it allows quick interfacing with code functions without having to install or run a local interpreter. For example, a complex credit scoring model built with neural nets can be interfaced with and used on the go by end users without worrying about transferring the binaries between each computer.

### A sample webapp

A web application framework for python that I've been using to great success is [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/#).

Flask has a simple (enough) folder structure which allows users to detach their analytic code from the web development overheads. It also allows usage of JS and CSS easily while staying completely in the python environment.
